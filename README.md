* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
* **npm** (usually included with Node.js)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally.

    git clone [https://github.com/ngoctrung05/latent-bidding-prototype.git](https://github.com/ngoctrung05/latent-bidding-prototype.git)
    cd latent-bidding-prototype
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    npm install
    ```

## Running Development Server

To start the local development server and run the application:

1.  Execute the following command:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

2.  Open your web browser and navigate to:
    http://localhost:5173/

*Note: If port `5173` is already in use on your machine, check the terminal output for the actual port assigned by Vite (e.g., `5174`).*
